TerrainApp is a real-time geographic data system allowing users to interact with terrain information, purchase terrain, and access various services.
Mapping Terrain Data: View location, altitude, terrain type, and environmental conditions.
Visualizing Terrain: 2D/3D interactive views, elevation profiles, and slope visualizations.
Modifying Terrain: Adjust terrain characteristics (e.g., altitude, terrain type, apply transformations like flood simulation).
Analyzing Terrain: Calculate elevation, slope, distances, and usability.
Buying Terrain: Browse and purchase terrains using integrated payment methods (credit card, digital wallets).
AI Recommendations: AI engine to suggest optimal land use (e.g., agriculture, construction).
User Profiles: Save and retrieve user preferences and terrain profiles.
Register as a User: Create an account for custom terrain data and preferences.
Create Terrain Profile: Define or upload custom terrain data.
View Terrain Data: View terrain details (type, weather, elevation, etc.).
Modify Terrain Data: Adjust terrain features (elevation, type).
Generate Reports: Terrain suitability analysis, elevation reports, etc.
AI-Powered Evaluation: Optimal land use suggestions based on terrain data.
Integrated Payment: Secure payment system for terrain purchases.
Select terrain, checkout, and choose payment method.
